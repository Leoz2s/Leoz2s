# Welcome! 👋🏼 I'm Leonardo Santos 👨🏻‍💻 

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a fullstack web developer from Mauá, São Paulo, Brazil.

I come from a industrial background where i worked as an industrial automation technician, my favorite aspect of this work was to program on Ladder language. But I realized that in the industrial context I was inserted in, programming wasn't the main focus, but just one part of the job, so I decided to become a software developer to deep dive in programming!
